## Understand the Problem
- Understand what the interviewer is asking and ask clarifying questions
- Generate basic sample input base case and output case. Understand how as a human being can get from an input to an output. Use a use case that a human will solve it
- Explore more unusual edge cases
- Explore tradeoffs (memory, performance, code simplicity)


## Plan the solution

- Describe the overall approach in one or two sentences.
- Write down steps in English. 
- Each step should be simple and clear.

3 Random Gate about battery_life


Inefficient way: Graph way

Problem: 

```python
"""
You are planning a cross-country road trip in an electric vehicle (EV). You are currently at the start of a long highway (index 0) and your goal is to reach the final charging hub located at the last index of the array.
Each element in the integer array battery_life represents your maximum driving range (in miles/indices) from that particular position. For example, if you are at battery_life[i] = 3, you can "jump" or drive to any index from i + 1 up to i + 3.
Return true if you can reach the final charging hub, or false otherwise.
