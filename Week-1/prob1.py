"""
Write a function transpose() that accepts a 2D integer array matrix and returns the transpose of matrix. The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, swapping the rows and columns.
"""

def transpose(matrix):

    # take the length of the row and column

    # understand how big the matrix is so that a for loop can create a new matrix with those flipped dimensions

    # nested loops?

    

    pass

"Example Usage:"
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
transpose(matrix)

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]
transpose(matrix)

"Example Output: "

[
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [3, 6, 9]
